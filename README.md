# Basic Compiler

This is a basic compiler written in Python. It is designed to compile a simple programming language into machine code.

## Features

- Lexical analysis: The compiler performs lexical analysis to break down the source code into tokens. # TBD
- Syntax analysis: The compiler performs syntax analysis to check the correctness of the program's structure. # TBD
- Semantic analysis: The compiler performs semantic analysis to ensure the program's meaning is correct. # TBD
- Code generation: The compiler generates machine code from the input program. # TBD

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic-compiler.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd basic-compiler
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the compiler:

   ```bash
   python basic_compiler.py
   ```

2. Run any commands. For example:
